> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is a fork of the original [DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp](https://github.com/DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp). It tracks upstream loosely: useful fixes and features are adopted selectively, but this fork does not mirror upstream releases or preserve identical storage behavior.

This fork combines codebase-memory-mcp's tree-sitter/LSP indexing and MCP tools with a **Zova-native shared database**. Zova owns graph topology and vector search in full-authority mode, enabling fast incremental publication, native traversal, compact large-repository storage, and searches spanning several indexed repositories.

High-quality parsing through [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) AST analysis across all 158 languages, enhanced with [**Hybrid LSP** semantic type resolution](#hybrid-lsp) for Python, TypeScript / JavaScript / JSX / TSX, PHP, C#, Go, C, C++, Java, Kotlin, and Rust — producing a persistent knowledge graph of functions, classes, call chains, HTTP routes, and cross-service links. 14 MCP tools. Zero dependencies. Plug and play across 11 coding agents.

## This fork

The current development version uses **CBM schema 7** with a pinned **Zova format 9 / ABI 0.25.0** SDK. Compared with the original pure-SQLite implementation, it adds:

- **One shared database** — multiple repositories live as isolated workspaces in `cbm.zova`.
- **Cross-repository discovery** — one `search_graph` request can search selected projects or every healthy workspace and identifies the owning project for each result.
- **Native graph and vectors** — topology, edge payloads, traversal indexes, and int8 vector collections use Zova's native stores rather than duplicate SQLite projections.
- **Incremental-first performance** — unchanged records are not republished; native delta APIs update only the affected graph, metadata, FTS, and vector records.
- **Exact compatibility checks** — benchmarked Zova results are required to match the pure-SQLite CBM result set exactly, with no unexpected fallback.

The shared Zova full-authority route is the default for indexing and queries. The original per-project SQLite route is retained only as an explicit compatibility and benchmark mode selected with `CBM_ZOVA_MODE=off`.

### Latest Zova-native results

ReleaseSafe medians compare this fork's Zova-native mode with the same CBM build using pure SQLite. Lower indexing time, storage, and vector p95 are better.

| Area | TOPS vs pure SQLite | Deno vs pure SQLite |
|---|---:|---:|
| Full indexing | 5.7% slower | 6.1% slower |
| Incremental indexing | 76.9% faster | 51.6% faster |
| Storage | 12.9% larger | 2.4% smaller |
| Vector p95 | 76.6% faster | 86.2% faster |
| Correctness | Exact | Exact |

Full indexing remains the current tradeoff. Zova's advantage is strongest for repeated indexing and vector retrieval; its fixed database overhead is more visible on a small repository such as TOPS, while it is already smaller than pure SQLite on Deno.

> **Research** — The design and benchmarks behind this project are described in the preprint [*Codebase-Memory: Tree-Sitter-Based Knowledge Graphs for LLM Code Exploration via MCP*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.27277) (arXiv:2603.27277). Evaluated across 31 real-world repositories: 83% answer quality, 10× fewer tokens, 2.1× fewer tool calls vs. file-by-file exploration.

> **Security & Trust** — This tool reads your codebase and writes to your agent configuration files. Audit the [fork source](https://github.com/0ctacity/codebase-memory-mcp) before running if required. Indexing and queries run locally; source code is not sent to a hosted service. Report security issues through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

</p>

## Why this fork

- **Fast updates after the first index** — native delta publication makes incremental indexing 51.6%–76.9% faster in the current TOPS and Deno benchmarks.
- **Cross-repository context** — search frontend, backend, libraries, or any other selected project set in one query without requiring repository names such as `frontend` or `backend`.
- **Exact results** — Zova-native benchmark parity is checked against the pure-SQLite implementation.
- **Plug and play** — release binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows on amd64 and arm64. No Docker, hosted service, or API key. Download → install → restart agent → done.
- **158 languages** — vendored tree-sitter grammars compiled into the binary. Nothing to install, nothing that breaks.
- **120x fewer tokens** — 5 structural queries: ~3,400 tokens vs ~412,000 via file-by-file search. One graph query replaces dozens of grep/read cycles.
- **11 agents, one command** — `install` auto-detects Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Zed, OpenCode, Antigravity, Aider, KiloCode, VS Code, OpenClaw, and Kiro — configures MCP entries, instruction files, and pre-tool hooks for each.
- **Built-in graph visualization** — 3D interactive UI at `localhost:9749` (optional UI binary variant).
- **Infrastructure-as-code indexing** — Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, and Kustomize overlays indexed as graph nodes with cross-references. `Resource` nodes for K8s kinds, `Module` nodes for Kustomize overlays with `IMPORTS` edges to referenced resources.
- **14 MCP tools** — search, trace, architecture, impact analysis, Cypher queries, dead code detection, cross-service HTTP linking, ADR management, and more.

## Quick Start

**One-line install** (macOS / Linux):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0ctacity/codebase-memory-mcp/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer is non-destructive by default. If a different binary or MCP
configuration already exists, replacement must be authorized explicitly with
`--replace` or `--replace-config`.

With graph visualization UI:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0ctacity/codebase-memory-mcp/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --ui
```

**Windows** (PowerShell):
```powershell
# 1. Download the installer
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0ctacity/codebase-memory-mcp/main/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1

# 2. (Optional but recommended) Inspect the script
notepad install.ps1

# 3. Unblock the downloaded file (removes Mark-of-the-Web restriction added by browsers/Invoke-WebRequest)
Unblock-File .\install.ps1

# 4. Run it
.\install.ps1

```

> **Note:** If you see a script execution policy error, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass` first, or invoke with `PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1`.

Options: `--ui` (graph visualization), `--skip-config` (binary only, no agent setup), `--dir=<path>` (custom location).

Restart your coding agent. Say **"Index this project"** — done.

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

1. **Download** the archive for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/0ctacity/codebase-memory-mcp/releases/latest):
   - `codebase-memory-mcp-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` (macOS/Linux) or `.zip` (Windows) — standard
   - `codebase-memory-mcp-ui-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` / `.zip` — with graph visualization

2. **Extract and install** (each archive includes `install.sh` or `install.ps1`):

   macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   tar xzf codebase-memory-mcp-*.tar.gz
   ./install.sh
   ```

   Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   Expand-Archive codebase-memory-mcp-windows-amd64.zip -DestinationPath .
   Unblock-File .\install.ps1
   .\install.ps1
   ```

3. **Restart** your coding agent.

The `install` command automatically strips macOS quarantine attributes and ad-hoc signs the binary — no manual `xattr`/`codesign` needed.
</details>

The `install` command auto-detects all installed coding agents and configures MCP server entries, instruction files, skills, and pre-tool hooks for each.

### Graph Visualization UI

If you downloaded the `ui` variant:

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp --ui=true --port=9749
```

Open `http://localhost:9749` in your browser. The UI runs as a background thread alongside the MCP server — it's available whenever your agent is connected.

### Auto-Index

Enable automatic indexing on MCP session start:

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_index true
```

When enabled, new projects are indexed automatically on first connection. Previously-indexed projects are registered with the background watcher for ongoing git-based change detection. Configurable file limit: `config set auto_index_limit 50000`.

Watcher registration is controlled separately by `auto_watch` (default `true`). Set `config set auto_watch false` to keep a session from registering its project with the background watcher — useful when working across many projects and you want each session contained to explicit indexing.

### Keeping Up to Date

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp update
```

The MCP server also checks for updates on startup and notifies on the first tool call if a newer release is available.

### Uninstall

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp uninstall
```

Removes the installed binary, agent configs, skills, hooks, and instructions. The shared `cbm.zova` database is kept.

## Features

### Graph & analysis
- **Architecture overview**: `get_architecture` returns languages, packages, entry points, routes, hotspots, boundaries, layers, and clusters in a single call
- **Architecture Decision Records**: `manage_adr` persists architectural decisions across sessions
- **Louvain community detection**: Discovers functional modules by clustering call edges
- **Git diff impact mapping**: `detect_changes` maps uncommitted changes to affected symbols with risk classification
- **Call graph**: Resolves function calls across files and packages (import-aware, type-inferred)
- **Dead code detection**: Finds functions with zero callers, excluding entry points
- **Cypher-like queries**: `MATCH (f:Function)-[:CALLS]->(g) WHERE f.name = 'main' RETURN g.name`

### Search
- **Semantic search** (`semantic_query`): vector search across the entire graph, powered by bundled Nomic `nomic-embed-code` embeddings (40K tokens, 768d int8) compiled into the binary — no API key, no Ollama, no Docker. 11-signal combined scoring (TF-IDF, RRI, API/Type/Decorator signatures, AST profiles, data flow, Halstead-lite, MinHash, module proximity, graph diffusion).
- **BM25 full-text search** via SQLite FTS5 with `cbm_camel_split` tokenizer (camelCase / snake_case aware)
- **Structural search** (`search_graph`): regex name patterns, label filters, min/max degree, file scoping
- **Code search** (`search_code`): graph-augmented grep over indexed files only

### Cross-service linking
- **HTTP** route ↔ call-site matching with confidence scoring
- **gRPC, GraphQL, tRPC** service detection with protobuf Route extraction
- **Channel detection** (`EMITS` / `LISTENS_ON`) for Socket.IO, EventEmitter, and generic pub-sub patterns across 8 languages with constant resolution

### Cross-repo intelligence
- **`CROSS_*` edges** link nodes across multiple repos indexed under the same store
- **Multi-galaxy 3D UI layout** for cross-repo architecture visualization
- **Cross-repo architecture summary** combining services, routes, and dependencies across the indexed fleet

### Edge types (selected)
- `CALLS`, `IMPORTS`, `DEFINES`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `INHERITS`
- `HTTP_CALLS`, `ASYNC_CALLS` (cross-service)
- `EMITS`, `LISTENS_ON` (channels)
- `DATA_FLOWS` with arg-to-param mapping + field access chains
- `SIMILAR_TO` (MinHash + LSH near-clone detection, Jaccard scored)
- `SEMANTICALLY_RELATED` (vocabulary-mismatch, same-language, score ≥ 0.80)

### Indexing pipeline
- **158 vendored tree-sitter grammars** compiled into the binary
- **Generic package / module resolution** — bare specifiers like `@myorg/pkg`, `github.com/foo/bar`, `use my_crate::foo` resolved via manifest scanning (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `composer.json`, `pubspec.yaml`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `mix.exs`, `*.gemspec`)
- **Infrastructure-as-code indexing** — Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, Kustomize overlays as graph nodes
- **[Hybrid LSP semantic type resolution](#hybrid-lsp)** for Python, TypeScript / JavaScript / JSX / TSX, PHP, C#, Go, C, C++, Java, Kotlin, and Rust — a lightweight C implementation of language type-resolution algorithms, structurally inspired by and compatible with major language servers including tsserver / typescript-go, pyright, gopls, Roslyn, Eclipse JDT, and rust-analyzer (parameter binding, return-type inference, generic substitution, JSX component dispatch, JSDoc inference for plain JS files, namespace + trait + late-static-binding resolution for PHP, file-scoped namespaces + records + LINQ method syntax for C#, class-hierarchy + overload + lambda resolution for Java, extension-function + scope-function resolution for Kotlin, trait-method + UFCS resolution for Rust)
- **Prepared Zova publication**: finalized nodes, grouped topology edges with compact payloads, metadata, FTS rows, and vectors are published atomically into the shared database.

### Distribution & operation
- **Single self-contained application, zero infrastructure**: Zova embeds SQLite and persists the shared full-authority store at `~/.cache/codebase-memory-mcp/cbm.zova`.
- **Auto-sync**: Background watcher detects file changes and re-indexes automatically
- **Route nodes**: REST endpoints are first-class graph entities
- **CLI mode**: `codebase-memory-mcp cli search_graph '{"name_pattern": ".*Handler.*"}'`
- **Release archives**: signed-by-checksum binaries and installers for macOS, Linux, and Windows on amd64 and arm64.

## Team-Shared Graph Artifact

Commit a single compressed file to your repo and your teammates skip the reindex.

`.codebase-memory/graph.db.zst` is a zstd-compressed snapshot of the knowledge graph that lives next to your source. When you index, the artifact is written or refreshed; when a teammate clones the repo and runs `codebase-memory-mcp` for the first time, the artifact is decompressed and incremental indexing fills in their local diff.

- **Format**: SQLite database, indexes stripped, `VACUUM INTO` compacted, then zstd 1.5.7 compressed (8–13:1 ratio typical)
- **Two tiers**:
  - **Best** (`zstd -9` + index strip + `VACUUM INTO`) — written on explicit `index_repository`
  - **Fast** (`zstd -3`) — written by the watcher for low-latency incremental updates
- **Bootstrap**: when no local DB exists but the artifact is present, `index_repository` imports the artifact first, then runs incremental indexing — avoiding the full reindex cost
- **No merge pain**: a `.gitattributes` line with `merge=ours` is auto-created on first export, so concurrent edits don't produce conflicts on the binary artifact
- **Optional**: never committed unless you want it. Add `.codebase-memory/` to `.gitignore` if you prefer everyone to reindex from scratch.

The result is similar in spirit to graphify's `graphify-out/` directory, but as a single compressed file with explicit two-tier export, integrity-checked import, and zero merge friction.

## How It Works

codebase-memory-mcp is a **structural analysis backend** — it builds and queries the knowledge graph. It does **not** include an LLM. Instead, it relies on your MCP client (Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible agent) to be the intelligence layer.

```
You: "what calls ProcessOrder?"

Agent calls: trace_path(function_name="ProcessOrder", direction="inbound")

codebase-memory-mcp: executes graph query, returns structured results

Agent: presents the call chain in plain English
```

**Why no built-in LLM?** Other code graph tools embed an LLM for natural language → graph query translation. This means extra API keys, extra cost, and another model to configure. With MCP, the agent you're already talking to *is* the query translator.

## Performance

The Zova-native comparison above is the current fork benchmark. The following upstream-scale figures remain useful as parser and query reference points, but they are not measurements of the current Zova full-authority route:

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Linux kernel full index** | **3 min** | 28M LOC, 75K files → 4.81M nodes, 7.72M edges |
| Linux kernel fast index | 1m 12s | 1.88M nodes |
| Django full index | ~6s | 49K nodes, 196K edges |
| Cypher query | <1ms | Relationship traversal |
| Name search (regex) | <10ms | SQL LIKE pre-filtering |
| Dead code detection | ~150ms | Full graph scan with degree filtering |
| Trace call path (depth=5) | <10ms | BFS traversal |

**RAM-first pipeline**: All indexing runs in memory (LZ4 HC compressed read, in-memory SQLite, single dump at end). Memory is released back to the OS after indexing completes.

**Token efficiency**: Five structural queries consumed ~3,400 tokens via codebase-memory-mcp versus ~412,000 tokens via file-by-file grep exploration — a **99.2% reduction**.

## Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

codebase-memory-mcp runs **100% locally and collects no telemetry** — your code, queries, environment, and usage never leave your machine. That privacy guarantee also means that when you hit something we can't reproduce on our side (a slow memory climb over hours, a performance regression, a leak that only appears after days of real use), **we have no data at all unless you choose to send it.** Here is how to capture it yourself.

### Capture a diagnostics log

Set `CBM_DIAGNOSTICS=1` before the MCP server starts, then reproduce the problem (let it run as long as it takes — a slow leak needs time to show in the trend). The server writes two files to your system temp directory (`$TMPDIR` or `/tmp` on macOS/Linux, `%TEMP%` on Windows):

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `cbm-diagnostics-<pid>.ndjson` | **The memory trajectory** — one JSON line every 5 s with `rss`, `committed` (Windows commit charge), `peak_*`, `page_faults`, `fd`, and `queries`. **This is the file we need for memory/leak reports** — the *trend over time* is what pinpoints a leak. It is **kept on disk after the server exits** (so you can grab it post-mortem) and rotates to `.ndjson.1` past ~8 MB. |
| `cbm-diagnostics-<pid>.json` | The latest snapshot only — handy for a quick live check. Removed on clean exit. |

The startup log prints both paths, e.g.:

```
level=info msg=diagnostics.start snapshot=/tmp/cbm-diagnostics-12345.json trajectory=/tmp/cbm-diagnostics-12345.ndjson interval=5s
```

Set the variable in the `env` block of your agent's MCP server config, or export it before launching the server.

### What to share

When you open a memory/performance issue, **attach the `.ndjson` trajectory** — it contains no source code or query text, only resource counters. If you'd rather not attach a file, paste it (or an agent's summary of it) into the issue: your assistant can read the NDJSON directly and report whether `rss`/`committed` grow monotonically, how fast, and relative to query count — which is exactly what we need to find the cause.

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

| Platform | Standard | With Graph UI |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `codebase-memory-mcp-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` | `codebase-memory-mcp-ui-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS (Intel) | `codebase-memory-mcp-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` | `codebase-memory-mcp-ui-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` |
| Linux (x86_64) | `codebase-memory-mcp-linux-amd64.tar.gz` | `codebase-memory-mcp-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz` |
| Linux (ARM64) | `codebase-memory-mcp-linux-arm64.tar.gz` | `codebase-memory-mcp-ui-linux-arm64.tar.gz` |
| Linux portable (x86_64) | `codebase-memory-mcp-linux-amd64-portable.tar.gz` | `codebase-memory-mcp-ui-linux-amd64-portable.tar.gz` |
| Linux portable (ARM64) | `codebase-memory-mcp-linux-arm64-portable.tar.gz` | `codebase-memory-mcp-ui-linux-arm64-portable.tar.gz` |
| Windows (x86_64) | `codebase-memory-mcp-windows-amd64.zip` | `codebase-memory-mcp-ui-windows-amd64.zip` |
| Windows (ARM64) | `codebase-memory-mcp-windows-arm64.zip` | `codebase-memory-mcp-ui-windows-arm64.zip` |

Every release includes `checksums.txt` with SHA-256 hashes, and the canonical
installer refuses an unverified network download. The portable Linux archives
are statically linked; the standard Linux archives target the release runner's
glibc. The installer selects portable Linux by default.

> **Windows note**: SmartScreen may show a warning for unsigned software. Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**. Verify integrity with `checksums.txt`.

### Build from Source

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites: C compiler + zlib</summary>

| Requirement | Check | Install |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **C compiler** (gcc or clang) | `gcc --version` or `clang --version` | macOS: `xcode-select --install`, Linux: `apt install build-essential` |
| **C++ compiler** | `g++ --version` or `clang++ --version` | Same as above |
| **zlib** | — | macOS: included, Linux: `apt install zlib1g-dev` |
| **Git** | `git --version` | Pre-installed on most systems |

</details>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0ctacity/codebase-memory-mcp.git
cd codebase-memory-mcp
scripts/build.sh                    # standard binary
scripts/build.sh --with-ui          # with graph visualization
# Binary at: build/c/codebase-memory-mcp
```

### Manual MCP Configuration

<details>
<summary>If you prefer not to use the install command</summary>

Add to `~/.claude/.mcp.json` (global) or project `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codebase-memory-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/codebase-memory-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your agent. Verify with `/mcp` — you should see `codebase-memory-mcp` with 14 tools.

</details>

## Multi-Agent Support

`install` auto-detects and configures all installed agents:

| Agent | MCP Config | Instructions | Hooks |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/.mcp.json` | 4 Skills | PreToolUse (Grep/Glob graph augment, non-blocking) |
| Codex CLI | `.codex/config.toml` | `.codex/AGENTS.md` | SessionStart reminder |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/settings.json` | `.gemini/GEMINI.md` | BeforeTool (grep reminder) + SessionStart reminder |
| Zed | `settings.json` (JSONC) | — | — |
| OpenCode | `opencode.json` | `AGENTS.md` | — |
| Antigravity | `.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (shared) | `antigravity-cli/AGENTS.md` | SessionStart reminder |
| Aider | — | `CONVENTIONS.md` | — |
| KiloCode | `mcp_settings.json` | `~/.kilocode/rules/` | — |
| VS Code | `Code/User/mcp.json` | — | — |
| OpenClaw | `openclaw.json` | — | — |
| Kiro | `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` | — | — |

**Hooks are structurally non-blocking** (exit code 0, every failure path).
For Claude Code, the `PreToolUse` hook intercepts `Grep`/`Glob` (never `Read` —
gating `Read` breaks the read-before-edit invariant) and, when the search
token matches indexed symbols, injects them as `additionalContext` via
`search_graph` so the agent gets structured context alongside its normal
search results. For Codex, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity, a `SessionStart` hook
injects a one-line code-discovery reminder as session context (Gemini CLI also
keeps its `BeforeTool` reminder).
The installed Claude shim file is named `cbm-code-discovery-gate` for
backward compatibility with existing installs; despite the legacy name it
never gates and never blocks.

## CLI Mode

Every MCP tool can be invoked from the command line:

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp cli index_repository '{"repo_path": "/path/to/repo"}'
codebase-memory-mcp cli search_graph '{"name_pattern": ".*Handler.*", "label": "Function"}'
codebase-memory-mcp cli trace_path '{"function_name": "Search", "direction": "both"}'
codebase-memory-mcp cli query_graph '{"query": "MATCH (f:Function) RETURN f.name LIMIT 5"}'
codebase-memory-mcp cli list_projects
codebase-memory-mcp cli --raw search_graph '{"label": "Function"}' | jq '.results[].name'
```

### Zova migration and rollback

Section 7 migration is an explicit operator action. It discovers the existing
project `.db` and sibling `.zova` in the resolved CBM cache and publishes their
verified generation into `cbm.zova`. Migrate, status, and rollback preserve the
source artifacts.

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp zova-migrate migrate --repo-path /absolute/path/to/repository --json
codebase-memory-mcp zova-migrate status --repo-path /absolute/path/to/repository --json
codebase-memory-mcp zova-migrate rollback --repo-path /absolute/path/to/repository --json
codebase-memory-mcp zova-migrate cleanup --repo-path /absolute/path/to/repository \
  --confirm-workspace w1_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef --json
```

The command prints one compact JSON object. Exit `0` means success or an
idempotent no-op, exit `1` means an operational failure, and exit `2` means a
usage error. Cleanup requires the exact reported workspace ID. It removes the
verified legacy bundle and permanently ends rollback availability for that
migration.

The wrapper exposes the same lifecycle:

```bash
scripts/zova-migrate-repo.sh migrate /absolute/path/to/repository
scripts/zova-migrate-repo.sh status /absolute/path/to/repository
scripts/zova-migrate-repo.sh rollback /absolute/path/to/repository
scripts/zova-migrate-repo.sh cleanup /absolute/path/to/repository \
  --confirm-workspace w1_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

The historical `scripts/zova-migrate-repo.sh REPOSITORY [RUN_ROOT]` form is a
`migrate` alias. The wrapper holds a run-root lock and retains the exact compact
JSON response as `runs/<run>/migration.json`; the default run root is
`build/zova-migrate`.

The one-file `cbm.zova` schema is documented in
[`docs/zova-single-file-schema.md`](docs/zova-single-file-schema.md).

### Zova backup, recovery, and workspace operations

The shared-database operator commands act only on
`${CBM_CACHE_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/codebase-memory-mcp}/cbm.zova` and emit exactly
one compact JSON object. Exit `0` means success or no-op, exit `1` means an
operational refusal/failure, and exit `2` means invalid command syntax.

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp zova-ops status --json
codebase-memory-mcp zova-ops backup --output /safe/path/cbm-backup.zova --json
codebase-memory-mcp zova-ops restore --input /safe/path/cbm-backup.zova --confirm-replace --json
codebase-memory-mcp zova-ops export-database --output /safe/path/database-archive --json
codebase-memory-mcp zova-ops import-database --input /safe/path/database-archive --confirm-replace --json
codebase-memory-mcp zova-ops export-workspace --workspace-id WORKSPACE_ID --output /safe/path/workspace-archive --json
codebase-memory-mcp zova-ops import-workspace --input /safe/path/workspace-archive --json

Full-database archives contain a versioned manifest and verified `data.zova`.
Workspace archives contain one workspace's metadata, canonical FTS, native
graph and vector payloads, file hashes, summary, generation, and integrity
digests; import rebuilds and verifies the native objects. Restore and database import
require the literal `--confirm-replace` flag. Workspace deletion requires the
exact target ID as `--confirm-workspace`.

Replacement is same-directory and resumable: the candidate is verified before
the live file moves, and interruption leaves either the preceding verified live
database or a retryable recovery artifact. Compaction runs only when reclaimable
space is at least both 64 MiB and 10 percent of the database, and requires free
space of at least the larger of 8 GiB or database bytes plus 1 GiB.

Health distinguishes `workspace_rebuild` from `whole_file_recovery`. A confined
workspace defect blocks only that flagged workspace until a full source rebuild
publishes successfully. Shared-schema, open, quick-check, foreign-key, or other
unattributable damage requires a verified full backup restore; without one,
explicit recovery quarantines the corrupt file and creates no replacement.

The wrapper builds once, applies the disk guard, serializes operations, writes
progress to stderr, and retains JSON reports under `build/zova-operations`:

```bash
scripts/zova-operations.sh status
scripts/zova-operations.sh backup --output /safe/path/cbm-backup.zova
```

The compact real-repository validation runner is:

```bash
scripts/zova-single-file-validation.sh
```

It retains only a JSON report on success.

The current schema is CBM v7 on Zova format v9. It removes projection
tables, duplicate workspace FTS/rowmaps, compatibility-vector tables, and the
separate native norm table. Native topology edges carry compact CBM payloads,
and fresh full publication uses Zova's prepared builder;
`CBM_MODE_INCREMENTAL` computes and commits an atomic delta without clearing
the workspace or rewriting unchanged rows. Migration from v5/v7 uses a
verified temporary database and resumable atomic replacement. The final
same-binary TOPS → motive → rvault → CBM optimization gate
passes; storage is 45.0%–60.1% lower than the documented pre-v6 Zova baseline,
and true incremental publication performs no full clear or unchanged-row rewrite.

### Reproducible Zova development builds

CBM builds against an immutable local snapshot in `.zova-sdk`, not the live
neighboring Zova checkout. Pin the currently built Zova library and headers
once, build the production binary, then build and run only the test groups you
request:

```bash
scripts/zova-pin-current.sh
scripts/zova-build-once.sh
scripts/zova-run-tests.sh zova mcp
```

`zova-build-once.sh` does not compile tests. `zova-run-tests.sh` selects a
focused Zova, MCP, or pipeline runner when possible; running it without suite
arguments builds and executes the complete C test runner used by CI. Focused
runners share one cached production-support library, so later groups compile
only their own test sources.

Later changes under `../zova` are ignored. Refresh the snapshot only when a
Zova update is intentionally being adopted:

```bash
scripts/zova-pin-current.sh --refresh
```

The wrapper keeps both CBM's Zig cache and the global Zig cache under
`build/.zova-build-cache`, and uses a build lock to reject overlapping builds.
It never writes the repository `.zig-cache`, so interrupted builds do not
poison the working tree. Real-repository validation keeps compact JSON
reports and deletes successful temporary databases, sidecars, logs, and caches.
It refuses to start with less than 8 GiB free by default; adjust that guard with
`CBM_ZOVA_MIN_FREE_GB` when necessary. Full four-repository, three-run gates are
promotion tests, not routine development tests.

## MCP Tools

### Indexing

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `index_repository` | Index a repository into the graph. Auto-sync keeps it fresh after that. |
| `list_projects` | List all indexed projects with node/edge counts. |
| `delete_project` | Remove a project and all its graph data. |
| `index_status` | Check indexing status of a project. |

### Querying

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_graph` | Structured search by label, name pattern, file pattern, degree filters. Pagination via limit/offset. |
| `trace_path` | BFS traversal — who calls a function and what it calls (alias: `trace_call_path`). Depth 1-5. |
| `detect_changes` | Map git diff to affected symbols + blast radius with risk classification. |
| `query_graph` | Execute Cypher-like graph queries (read-only). |
| `get_graph_schema` | Node/edge counts, relationship patterns, property definitions per label. Run this first. |
| `get_code_snippet` | Read source code for a function by qualified name. |
| `get_architecture` | Codebase overview: languages, packages, routes, hotspots, clusters, ADR. |
| `search_code` | Grep-like text search within indexed project files. |
| `manage_adr` | CRUD for Architecture Decision Records. |
| `ingest_traces` | Ingest runtime traces to validate HTTP_CALLS edges. |

### Cross-repository search with Zova

When Zova full authority is enabled, `search_graph` can search several repositories stored in the
shared Zova database in one request:

```json
{"projects":["codebase-memory-mcp","AnotherFolder/codebase-memory-mcp"],"query":"update user profile"}
```

Use `{"projects":["*"]}` to search every ready, healthy workspace. BM25, structural filters, and
`semantic_query` are ranked and paginated across the combined scope. Every result includes its
owning `project`; pass that value and the returned `qualified_name` to `get_code_snippet`.

Selectors come from canonical repository paths. The first registered repository claims its
directory basename. A later basename collision receives the shortest unique parent-qualified
name, such as `AnotherFolder/codebase-memory-mcp`. `list_projects` reports these selectors,
canonical roots, generations, and health.

This feature provides cross-repository discovery, not cross-workspace topology. `query_graph` and
`trace_path` remain scoped to one repository; sharing a database does not create graph edges
between unrelated workspaces.

## Graph Data Model

### Node Labels

`Project`, `Package`, `Folder`, `File`, `Module`, `Class`, `Function`, `Method`, `Interface`, `Enum`, `Type`, `Route`, `Resource`

### Edge Types

`CONTAINS_PACKAGE`, `CONTAINS_FOLDER`, `CONTAINS_FILE`, `DEFINES`, `DEFINES_METHOD`, `IMPORTS`, `CALLS`, `HTTP_CALLS`, `ASYNC_CALLS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `HANDLES`, `USAGE`, `CONFIGURES`, `WRITES`, `MEMBER_OF`, `TESTS`, `USES_TYPE`, `FILE_CHANGES_WITH`

### Qualified Names

`get_code_snippet` uses qualified names: `<project>.<path_parts>.<name>`. Use `search_graph` to discover them first.

### Supported Cypher (openCypher read subset)

`query_graph` is a read-only openCypher subset:

- **Clauses**: `MATCH`, `OPTIONAL MATCH`, multiple `MATCH`, `WHERE`, `WITH` (+ `WITH … WHERE`), `RETURN`, `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, `LIMIT`, `DISTINCT`, `UNWIND`, `UNION` / `UNION ALL`, `CASE`.
- **Patterns**: labelled nodes, label alternation `(n:A|B)`, relationship types/direction, variable-length paths `[*1..3]`, inline property maps.
- **WHERE**: `= <> < <= > >=`, `AND/OR/XOR/NOT`, `IN`, `CONTAINS`, `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`, `IS [NOT] NULL`, regex `=~`, label test `n:Label`, and `EXISTS { (n)-[:TYPE]->() }` (single-hop existence — great for dead-code, e.g. `WHERE NOT EXISTS { (f)<-[:CALLS]-() }`).
- **Aggregates**: `count` (+`DISTINCT`), `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `collect`.
- **Functions**: `labels`, `type`, `id`, `keys`, `properties`; `toLower/toUpper/toString/toInteger/toFloat/toBoolean`; `size`, `length`, `trim/ltrim/rtrim`, `reverse`; `coalesce`, `substring`, `replace`, `left`, `right`.

Anything outside this subset (write/`MERGE`/`CALL` clauses, unsupported functions, list/map literals, comprehensions, path functions, parameters) **fails with a clear `unsupported …` error** rather than returning empty results.

## Ignoring Files

Layered: hardcoded patterns (`.git`, `node_modules`, etc.) → `.gitignore` hierarchy → `.cbmignore` (project-specific, gitignore syntax). Symlinks are always skipped.

See [docs/cbmignore.md](docs/cbmignore.md) for the full `.cbmignore` how-to: syntax, precedence across the ignore layers, and negation semantics.

## Configuration

```bash
codebase-memory-mcp config list                          # show all settings
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_index true           # auto-index on session start
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_index_limit 50000    # max files for auto-index
codebase-memory-mcp config set auto_watch false          # don't register background git watcher (default: true)
codebase-memory-mcp config reset auto_index              # reset to default
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CBM_ALLOWED_ROOT` | *(unset)* | Restrict `index_repository` to paths within this directory. When set, a `repo_path` that resolves (after symlink / `..` resolution) outside this root is refused; unset imposes no restriction. Useful when the server may be driven by an untrusted caller, e.g. agentic or multi-tenant deployments. |
| `CBM_CACHE_DIR` | `~/.cache/codebase-memory-mcp` | Override the database storage directory. All project indexes and config are stored here. |
| `CBM_DIAGNOSTICS` | `false` | Set to `1` or `true` to enable periodic diagnostics output to `/tmp/cbm-diagnostics-<pid>.json`. |
| `CBM_DOWNLOAD_URL` | *(GitHub releases)* | Override the download URL for updates. Used for testing or self-hosted deployments. |
| `CBM_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Set the minimum log level. Accepted values (case-insensitive): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `none` — or their numeric equivalents `0`–`4` matching the internal enum. Logs go to stderr; stdout is reserved for MCP JSON-RPC. |
| `CBM_WORKERS` | *(detected)* | Set the indexing worker count. `0` selects the sequential path; `1`–`256` selects an explicit worker count. Unset or invalid values use automatic detection. |
| `CBM_DUMP_VERIFY_MIN_RATIO` | `0.5` | After indexing, compare persisted SQLite node count to the in-memory dump count. When persisted nodes fall below this fraction of committed nodes (and committed > 50), `index_repository` returns `status:"degraded"` instead of silent `indexed`. Range 0–1; set `0` to disable. Invalid values are ignored with a warning. |

```bash
# Store indexes in a custom directory
export CBM_CACHE_DIR=~/my-projects/cbm-data
```

## Custom File Extensions

The JSON config files support a single key, `extra_extensions`, which maps additional file extensions to supported languages. Useful for framework-specific extensions like `.blade.php` (Laravel) or `.mjs` (ES modules). (For other tunables, see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) and the `config` subcommand above.)

Need the full config-file reference? See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

**Per-project** (in your repo root):
```json
// .codebase-memory.json
{"extra_extensions": {".blade.php": "php", ".mjs": "javascript"}}
```

**Global** (applies to all projects):
```json
// ~/.config/codebase-memory-mcp/config.json  (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/...)
{"extra_extensions": {".twig": "html", ".phtml": "php"}}
```

Each entry maps an extension (which **must** start with `.`) to a language name. Language names are matched **case-insensitively**. Accepted values (aliases in parentheses) are:

`bash` (`sh`), `c`, `c++` (`cpp`), `c#` (`csharp`), `clojure`, `cmake`, `cobol`, `common lisp` (`commonlisp`, `lisp`), `css`, `cuda`, `dart`, `dockerfile`, `elixir`, `elm`, `emacs lisp` (`emacslisp`), `erlang`, `f#` (`fsharp`), `form`, `fortran`, `glsl`, `go`, `graphql`, `groovy`, `haskell`, `hcl` (`terraform`), `html`, `ini`, `java`, `javascript`, `json`, `julia`, `kotlin`, `lean`, `lua`, `magma`, `makefile`, `markdown`, `matlab`, `meson`, `nix`, `objective-c` (`objc`), `ocaml`, `perl`, `php`, `protobuf`, `python`, `r`, `ruby`, `rust`, `scala`, `scss`, `sql`, `svelte`, `swift`, `toml`, `tsx`, `typescript`, `verilog`, `vimscript`, `vue`, `wolfram`, `xml`, `yaml`, `zig`.

Project config overrides global for conflicting extensions. An entry whose language name is unknown, or whose extension does not start with `.`, is skipped and a warning is logged to stderr (shown at the default `info` log level). Missing config files are ignored.

## Persistence

All indexed projects persist as isolated workspaces in the shared
`${CBM_CACHE_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/codebase-memory-mcp}/cbm.zova` database. The
database uses WAL mode and survives agent and machine restarts. Pure-SQLite
per-project `.db` files are used only when the explicit compatibility mode
`CBM_ZOVA_MODE=off` is selected.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `/mcp` doesn't show the server | Check `.mcp.json` path is absolute. Restart agent. Test: `echo '{}' \| /path/to/binary` should output JSON. |
| `index_repository` fails | Pass absolute path: `index_repository(repo_path="/absolute/path")` |
| `trace_path` returns 0 results | Use `search_graph(name_pattern=".*PartialName.*")` first to find the exact name. |
| Queries return wrong project results | Add `project="name"` parameter. Use `list_projects` to see names. |
| Binary not found after install | Add to PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` |
| UI not loading | Ensure you downloaded the `ui` variant and ran `--ui=true`. Check `http://localhost:9749`. |

## Hybrid LSP

**Semantic type resolution beyond tree-sitter.**

Tree-sitter alone gives a syntactic AST. That handles naming, structure, and call sites well, but it can't tell you that `user.profile.display_name()` resolves to `Profile.display_name` declared three modules away — tree-sitter doesn't track imports, generics, inheritance, or stdlib types.

codebase-memory-mcp ships a **lightweight C implementation of language type-resolution algorithms, structurally inspired by and compatible with major language servers** (tsserver / typescript-go, pyright, gopls, Roslyn, Eclipse JDT, rust-analyzer), embedded directly into the static binary. No language server process, no per-project setup, no API key. We call this layer **Hybrid LSP**: it runs alongside tree-sitter on every parse and refines `CALLS`, `USAGE`, and `RESOLVED_CALLS` edges with type information, so the resulting graph mirrors what an IDE "Go to Definition" would resolve.

**Languages with full Hybrid LSP:**

| Language | What it handles |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Python** *(new in v0.7.0)* | imports + dotted submodule walks, dataclasses, `Self` return types, generics, `@property`, `match/case` class patterns, SQLAlchemy 2.0 `Mapped[T]`, Pydantic `BaseModel`, `typing.Annotated` / `ClassVar` / `Final` / `InitVar`, async/await, classmethod/staticmethod, narrowing (`isinstance` / `is not None` / walrus), `typing.cast` / `assert_type`, common stdlib (logging, pathlib, json, functools). Target ~95% resolution on idiomatic code. |
| **TypeScript / JavaScript / JSX / TSX** | generics, JSX component dispatch, JSDoc inference for plain JS, `.d.ts` declarations, module re-exports, method chaining via return-type propagation, per-file overlay chained to a shared cross-file registry |
| **PHP** *(new in v0.7.0)* | namespaces, traits, late-static-binding, PHPDoc inference, parameter binding, return-type inference |
| **C#** *(new in v0.7.0)* | global usings, file-scoped namespaces, records (incl. C# 12 primary constructors), LINQ method syntax, `async Task<T>` / `ValueTask<T>` unwrap, generic methods, `this` / `base` dispatch, `var` inference, common BCL stdlib |
| **Go** *(sharpened in v0.7.0)* | pre-built per-package cross-file registry, generics, embedded structs, interface satisfaction, package-aware import resolution |
| **C / C++** *(sharpened in v0.7.0)* | pre-built per-language cross-file registry shared across C and C++; C side handles macros + `typedef` chains + header-vs-source linking; C++ side handles templates, namespaces, `auto` inference, and method resolution via class hierarchy |
| **Java** *(new in v0.8.0)* | imports (single-type, on-demand, static), class hierarchies with `this` / `super` dispatch, generics, annotations, overload matching by arity and parameter types, lambdas / method references bound to functional interfaces, field-type inference, common JDK stdlib |
| **Kotlin** *(new in v0.8.0)* | imports + same-package resolution, classes / objects / companion objects, extension functions, data classes, nullable-type unwrapping, scope functions (`let` / `apply` / `run` / `also` / `with`), infix calls, common stdlib |
| **Rust** *(new in v0.8.0)* | `use` declarations + module paths, `impl` blocks and trait methods, struct fields, generics with trait bounds, operator-trait desugaring, derive-macro method synthesis, UFCS static paths, common std prelude |

**Two-layer architecture:**

1. **Tree-sitter pass** — fast, syntactic, runs for every one of the 158 languages. Extracts definitions, calls, imports.
2. **Hybrid LSP pass** — type-aware, runs above the tree-sitter pass per-language. Refines call edges using the import graph plus a per-file or pre-built cross-file definition registry. Languages without a Hybrid LSP pass yet fall back to textual resolution, so you always get *some* answer.

The result is a knowledge graph accurate enough to drive `trace_path` across packages, inheritance hierarchies, and stdlib calls — without paying for a language server process per project.

## Security

Indexing, storage, vector search, and graph queries run locally. The project does not upload source
code or require a hosted database, API key, or model service. Release archives include SHA-256
checksums, and the installers verify the selected archive before extraction. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and the current security policy.
